- Manifest link
- Service worker registration
- Apple-specific tags for iOS installation

### 4. **Install Prompt Component** (`/components/PWAInstallPrompt.tsx`)

## 🎨 Create Your App Icons

**You need to create icons before deploying.** Here's the easiest way:

### Option 1: Online Favicon Generator (Recommended)

1. **Create a simple logo:**
   - Use Canva, Figma, or any design tool
   - Size: 512x512px
   - Background: #4C3F6C (purple)
   - Text: "iktara" in white
   - Save as PNG

2. **Generate all icons:**
   - Go to https://realfavicongenerator.net/
   - Upload your 512x512px logo
   - Download the generated icons
   - Place all PNG files in `/public/icons/`

### Option 2: Use the SVG Template

We've created an SVG template at `/public/icons/icon-template.svg`. 

**Convert it to PNGs:**
1. Open the SVG in a browser
2. Use an online converter like:
   - https://cloudconvert.com/svg-to-png
   - https://www.iloveimg.com/
3. Export at these sizes:
   - 72x72, 96x96, 128x128, 144x144
   - 152x152, 192x192, 384x384, 512x512
4. Name them: `icon-72x72.png`, `icon-96x96.png`, etc.
5. Place in `/public/icons/`

### Option 3: Quick Placeholder Icons

For testing, you can use simple colored squares:
1. Use https://placeholder.com/
2. Download purple squares at each size
3. Add "iktara" text using an image editor

## 📂 Required Icon Files

Place these in `/public/icons/`:

```
